## Concept

The idea is to create a smart heating system that uses machine learning to optimize energy consumption while maintaining optimal comfort in the home.

## Main features

### 1. Habit learning

The system learns the occupants' habits:
- Wake and sleep times
- Temperature preferences by room
- Presence in different areas of the house

### 2. Weather prediction

Integration with weather services to anticipate heating needs:
- Preventive adjustment before temperature changes
- Optimization based on short-term forecasts

### 3. Energy optimization

- Automatic reduction of heating in unoccupied rooms
- Dynamic adjustment based on each room's insulation
- Integration with renewable energy production systems

## Envisioned technologies

- **IoT Sensors** : Temperature, humidity, presence
- **Machine Learning** : Prediction and optimization algorithms
- **User interface** : Mobile and web application
- **Protocols** : MQTT for communication between devices

## Advantages

- Energy consumption reduction of up to 30%
- Improved comfort through personalization
- Reduced environmental impact
- Savings on energy bills

## Next steps

1. Prototyping with basic sensors
2. Development of the learning algorithm
3. Testing in real conditions
4. Continuous iteration and improvement
